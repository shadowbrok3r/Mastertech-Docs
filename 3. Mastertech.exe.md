The Mastertech executable is an incredibly powerful technician tool. It is broken down into "Views" or "Tabs" that can be moved around, dragged, and resized to fit your needs. Each of the views are explained here:

<h4>Submitting TUR Tasks</h4>
This is by far the most used and most important "View" for technicians in Mastertech. You will use this to send computer information to the salesperson including as much ammo as possible.

In short you can enter an Everest OR Prestashop order number and auto-populate all the relevant customer info and check-in notes. There is a section to write out your recommendations

See [[3.1 TUR Sheet View]] for a detailed explanation on this section of the program.

<h4>File Browser</h4>
There is a built in file browser tab. By default this shows on the left when opening Mastertech.exe.
This implements most of the same features as the windows file explorer and can be a useful alternative to robocopy if you need to copy some- but not all- of a folder's contents.
