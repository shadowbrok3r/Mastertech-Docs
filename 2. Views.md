The Mastertech application *and* website are built on EGUI which gives a lot of customizability to layouts.  The App is broken down into tabs or "Views" that can be placed just about anywhere in the program you would like. 

*As of now layouts always open to the default layout but a way to save default layouts is in the works at a later date*

Click and drag the title bar of any view to change it's location- 
it can be docked into the same zone as an existing tab by dropping the title bar into the center square icon:

this makes it easier to switch between multiple tabs *like a web browser* 


or alternatively placed to one of the sides of a tab to create a new division of that zone

*looks similar to putting 2 windows on the same monitor- splits the area of the destination tab in half *


If you need to open a closed view click on the top left "View" tab to toggle on/off any of your tabs
