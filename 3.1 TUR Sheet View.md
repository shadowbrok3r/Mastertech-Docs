<h2>Pulling Tickets</h2>
<h4>Service #:</h4>
**This field must be filled out to pull a ticket. Tickets can be pulled from Everest or Prestashop.**
*(Everest)*
Type in a service order number and click "Get Ticket" to autofill customer information and check-in notes. 

*(Prestashop)*
Type in the Prestashop order number **excluding any letters and leading zeros** and click "Get Prestashop" to autofill customer information and check-in notes. 

***Customer Name, Phone Numbers, Check-in Notes, Salesman and/or Technician should all be pulled***

<h4>Salesman / Technician Initials</h4>
After pulling a ticket you may notice the salesman, the technician, or both may appear below in the format {first_name}.{last_name}. 
This is because Mastertech is using the employee's email address (without the domain part) to identify a unique employee between Prestashop, Everest, and the Mastertech website seamlessly.

this will autofill based on rep/split-rep fields in (Everest/Prestashop). Make sure to update these if needed (for example the auto-filled salesperson is on their day off)

The only accepted format is: {first_name}.{last_name} *Ex: brett.knowlton* 
**so make sure you know how to spell your co-worker's name right!**

<h4>Get Keys</h4>
After typing the service order number you may also click the "Get Keys" Button - this will pull the antivirus directly from scaffold using the appropriate  service order number. 

*note: Clicking on the "Webroot Key" and "SuperAnti Key" Buttons after the keys have been pulled will COPY the keys to your clipboard to significantly speed up activations!*

<h4>Check SEB</h4>
***This button is not implemented yet but if SEB is installed it will run the function automatically when Mastertech opens- check the terminal to see SEB info***

This will use the customer's email to pull activation status of SEB from SEB's servers, this can be useful for checking if an SEB will need to be reset for a renewal or sometimes to check why an SEB may be failing with AR.


<h2>System TUR Info</h2>
This section to the right of the "pulling tickets" section is important to fill out before sending tur sheets.

The left column of this grouping includes drop downs where you can select the results of standard hardware tests for RAM, SSDs, and HDDs

The top right button is a **date picker**- this can be useful if you need to assign a task to someone *tomorrow* for example or even a week out in some situations.

There is a **Send System Info** checkbox that will send a payload of system information along with the tur sheet if checked. It is recommended to check this box as often as possible- the only situations where you would NOT want to do this is if Mastertech is being run on a system *other* than the customer's system. 
(For example: a dead motherboard you would need to submit a TUR sheet on a secondary system)
