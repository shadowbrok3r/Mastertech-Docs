Download the latest .exe from the website [master-tech.app](https://master-tech.app) (aka MtechServer)

<h4>Signing In / First Glance</h4>
Before using the Mastertech application you will need to create an account. You will use your PC Laptops email to create an account (if you haven't already).  It will ask you for your store and initials - be careful setting this account up as it is somewhat archaic and can be difficult to change account properties at this time.

*if you do accidentally place yourself in the wrong store or incorrect initials contact Logan to get that updated*

***as of right now there is no way to reset your password- make sure to type carefully and remember what you set the password to be. In a worst-case scenario contact Logan if you need help re-creating your account***

You will use this account to sign into MTech Server as well as mastertech.exe. What you will probably see first after signing in is your task board. (See [[4. MtechServer]]) 

For now just click the "Downloads" button at the top right and download the latest executable.

<h3>Tur Sheets and Tasks - The general process</h3>
The main job of every tech is to get ammo to the salesperson.
Mastertech is a super quick way to create and send ammo sheets to a central place- the [master-tech.app](https://master-tech.app) website - where each ammo sheet will create a "Task" in the salesperson's name. 

When you finish a computer off of the check-in shelf- regardless of the reason it was checked in, you should create a tur sheet with Mastertech. Write out any and all recommendations you have and send it to the appropriate salesperson. 
See [[Recommendations]]

Tasks can be created by hand on the website but it is not recommended for services- This is because when Mastertech creates a task it can include things like hardware information, SEB activation status, and all customer information including emails/phone numbers.

***See*** [[3.1 TUR Sheet View]] ***for a detailed explanation on how to use this part of Mastertech.***

After a customer is given a TUR call- the salesmen can then re-assign that task back to the technician to complete any repairs/upgrades. In the event of a sale this task can be used to put notes on specifics for the new machine (QC notes) and track the entire customer experience until checkout. 

Upon checkout the task can be completed to get it out of your way but you can still look this up any time or (someday) see it in the customer history.

This system is awesome for making sure nothing falls through the cracks or gets forgotten about and can also be used for miscellaneous store tasks.


<h3>Starting Layout</h3>
The master tech app and website are built on EGUI which gives a lot of customizability to each. The App is broken down into tabs or "Views" that can be placed just about anywhere in the program you would like. 

Click and drag the title bar of any view to change it's location- 
it can be placed in the same area as an existing tab to make it easy to switch between multiple *(like web browser tabs)*- 
or alternatively placed to one of the sides of a tab to create a new division of that zone *(like putting 2 windows on the same monitor)*
 See: [[4. Mastertech.exe Views]] & [[5. MtechServer Views]]

Running the executable should start you out on the tur sheet view alongside a few others. 
To the left is a built in file browser
Underneath there are many tabs for miscellaneous (and useful) tools/information.

The tur-sheet view will most likely be your most used view/tab. It is used to submit tur tasks to the website

*(Everest)*
Type in a service order number and click "Get Ticket" to autofill customer information and check-in notes. 

*(Prestashop)*
Type in the Prestashop order number **excluding any letters and leading zeros** and click "Get Prestashop" to autofill customer information and check-in notes.
